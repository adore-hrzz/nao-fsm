Protocol
========

Protocol starts when NAO is set in initial standing position.

First NAO has to find object. Object can be placed near NAO, or away from him.
If object is placed away from NAO, NAO has to move to it.

After that, NAO has to grab object, pick it up, do the gesture depending on which object he grabed and then put it back to it's place.

In the end, NAO has to track object and detect whether same gesture as NAO did was repeated with object or not.
